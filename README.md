      This repository contains the template code for the IRWA Final Project - Search Engine with Web Analytics.
      The project is implemented using Python and the Flask web framework. It includes a simple web application that allows users to search through a collection of documents and view analytics about their searches.

## To download this repo locally

Open a terminal console and execute:
```
cd <your preferred projects root directory>
git clone https://github.com/victorbrull/irwa-search-engine.git
```

## Setting up the Python environment (only for the first time you run the project)

> **Python ≥ 3.10 is required** (`numpy==2.2.6` in `requirements.txt` does not install on 3.8/3.9). We use Python 3.11.
> If `virtualenv` is not available you can also use `python3.11 -m venv irwa_venv`.
### Install virtualenv
Setting up a virtualenv is recommended to isolate the project dependencies from other Python projects on your machine.
It allows you to manage packages on a per-project basis, avoiding potential conflicts between different projects.

In the project root directory execute:
```bash
pip3 install virtualenv
virtualenv --version
```

### Prepare virtualenv for the project
In the root of the project folder run to create a virtualenv named `irwa_venv`:
```bash
virtualenv irwa_venv
```

If you list the contents of the project root directory, you will see that it has created a new folder named `irwa_venv` that contains the virtualenv:
```bash
ls -l
```

The next step is to activate your new virtualenv for the project:
```bash
source irwa_venv/bin/activate
```

or for Windows...
```cmd
irwa_venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

This will load the python virtualenv for the project.

### Installing Flask and other packages in your virtualenv
Make sure you are in the root of the project folder and that your virtualenv is activated (you should see `(irwa_venv)` in your terminal prompt).
And then install all the packages listed in `requirements.txt` with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The NER part of the analysis also needs the small English spaCy model:
```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

If you need to add more packages in the future, you can install them with pip and then update `requirements.txt` with:
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Enjoy!


## Starting the Web App
```bash
python -V
# Make sure we use Python 3

cd irwa-search-engine
python web_app.py
```
The above will start a web server with the application:
```
 * Serving Flask app 'web-app' (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:8088/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

Open Web app in your Browser:  
[http://127.0.0.1:8088/](http://127.0.0.1:8088/) or [http://localhost:8088/](http://localhost:8088/)


## Creating your own GitHub repo
After creating the project and code in local computer...

1. Login to GitHub and create a new repo.
2. Go to the root page of your new repo and note the url from the browser.
3. Execute the following locally:
```bash
cd <project root folder>
git init -b main
git add . && git commit -m "initial commit"
git remote add origin <your GitHub repo URL from the browser>
git push -u origin main
```

## Usage: 
0. Put the data files `fashion_products_dataset.json` and `validation_labels.csv` in the `data` folder. It will be provided to you by the instructor.
1. As for Parts 1, 2, and 3 of the project, please use the `project_progress` folder to store your solutions. Each part should contain `.pdf` file with your report and `.ipynb` (Jupyter Notebook) file with your code for solution and `README.md` with explanation of the content and instructions for results reproduction.
2. For the Part 4, of the project, you should build a web application using Flask that allows users to search through a collection of documents and view analytics about their searches. You should work mailnly in the `web_app.py` file `myapp` and `templates` folders. Feel free to change any code or add new files as needed. The provided code is just a starting point to help you get started quickly.
3. Make sure to update the `.env` file with your Groq API key (can be found [here](https://groq.com/), the free version is more than enough for our purposes) and any other necessary configurations. IMPORTANT: Do not share your `.env` file publicly as it contains sensitive information. It is included in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits. (It should never be included in the repos and appear here only for demonstration purposes).
4. Have fun and be creative!
